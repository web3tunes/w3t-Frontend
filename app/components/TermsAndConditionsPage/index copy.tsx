                TechVen prohibits the solicitation, offer, purchase, sale or
                distribution of securities on the Site. Users, Collectors,
                Applicants, Creators, App users, and other persons (“Persons”)
                agree not to use the Site, Creative Works or UDC’s to solicit,
                offer, purchase, sell or otherwise distribute securities. No
                Creative Works or UDC’s are intended to be classified as a
                security and no transaction in any Creative Work or UDC is
                intended to constitute a securities transaction under Australian
                federal or state laws, or by foreign authorities.

                    seek to register or rely on an exemption from such
                    registration or license to facilitate the offer and sale of

                    Works or UDC’s which are not securities. In the event that
                    TechVen determines there is a reasonable basis upon which to
                    conclude that a Creative Work or UDC is a security or
                    transactions in a Creative Work or UDC constitute securities
                    transactions, such Creative Work or UDC will be removed from

                    <strong>Creative Work Sales.</strong>
                    Collectors do not pay any fees related to the initial
                    purchase of UDC’s. Secondary sales of any UDC’s that take
                    place on the Smart Contract will result in a disclosed
                    percentage of the purchase amount distributed from the
                    secondary purchaser to Creator. Any fees imposed by TechVen,
                    due to TechVen by the Creator, or any payments due to the
                    Creator by TechVen shall be outlined in the Creator Terms.
                    TechVen may introduce premium services and impose fees
                    related to such services in the future. Primary and
                    secondary sales of UDC’s that take place on the Smart
                    Contract must be paid as per the purchase conditions at the
                    time.

                    You are solely responsible for determining what, if any,
                    taxes apply to your purchases and sales of UDC’s. TechVen is

                    TechVen is not responsible for exploits that are not
                    reasonably foreseeable. While TechVen has taken a number of
                    precautions to ensure the security of the Smart Contract,
                    the technology is relatively new, and it is not possible to
                    guarantee that the code is 100% free from bugs or errors.

                    The UDC’s are minted and transferred on the Smart Contract
                    maintained by TechVen. Any transfers of UDC’s occur via the
                    Smart Contract located on the Polygon blockchain and not on
                    this Site.

                    There is a risk that TechVen may be obligated to take down
                    listings and remove Creative Works from the Site if it has
                    received a Digital Millennium Copyright Notice (“DMCA
                    Notice”) under Section 16. TechVen may also be obligated to
                    serve a DMCA Notice to its IPFS service provider. If this
                    occurs, the UDC may no longer reference the Creative Work.
                    Creative Works linked to images and/or audio files subject
                    to a DMCA Notice may subsequently lose value.
